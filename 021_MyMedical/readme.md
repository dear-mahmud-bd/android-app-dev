# MyMedical -a Digital Solution for Patient Records
With this app,
- Patents can securely store their medical records digitally, unlike traditional paper-based record systems.
- To use this app, Accounts should be created separately for registered doctors and patients.
- We have our own admin panel to verify the account created.
- Registered and verified doctors will prescribe to the patient against his/her patient id.
- Patients can only view their previous health records.

Overall, this app will help patients to store their health record data securely and retrieve health records quickly.
